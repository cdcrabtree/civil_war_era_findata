There is exchange rate data available from the *Merchants' Magazine* and 
*Bankers' Magazine* for this era.

```{r bankers_fx}
bankers_fx <- read_csv("../data/bankers_magazine_exchange_rates.csv") %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date),
         city_type = paste(city, type),
         rate_mean = 0.5 * (rate_low + rate_high))
greenbacks <- read_csv("../data/greenbacks_fill.csv") %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))

bankers_fx %<>% left_join(greenbacks, by = "date") %>%
  mutate(mean = ifelse(date < as.Date("1862-1-1"), 1, mean),
         rate_mean = ifelse(city == "Paris", 1 / rate_mean, rate_mean))

ggplot(data = bankers_fx, aes(y = rate_mean, x = date)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ city_type, scales = "free_y")
