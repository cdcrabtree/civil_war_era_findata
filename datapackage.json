These periods are\n    filled in by gold price quotations from the nearby Wilmington,\n    North Carolina, money market, whose prices were often quoted\n    in the Richmond newspapers.  Newspapers from Petersburg, North\n    Carolina, Virginia,Mobile, Alabama, Wilmington, Virginia,\n    Raleigh, North Carolina, Lynchburg, Augusta, Georgia,\n    Columbus, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, were also\n    examined for price quotes from the Richmond market(see\n    Appendix).Often, these papers would quote trades not reported\n    in the Richmond newspapers.  In addition, secondary markets\n    existed in most of these cities, although these gold exchanges\n    tended to be considerably less liquid than the Richmond\n    market.\n\nFrom Weidenmier (2002), p. 890,\n\n    Grayback/gold price quotations were taken from the following\n    newspapers:Richmond Dispatch, Richmond Examiner, Richmond\n    Whig, Richmond Enquirer, Petersburg Express,\n    Wilmington Journal, Columbus Daily-Sun,\n    Charleston Mercury,Lynchburg Virginian,and the Mobile\n    Tribune.Richmondgrayback/gold price quotations were also\n    cross-checked against prices in the Raleigh, Augusta,and Mobile\n    gold markets using the following newspapers: Raleigh\n    Weekly Register, Mobile Tribune,Mobile Advertiser and Register,\n    and Augusta Daily Constitutionalist.  \n",

      "description": "Price of Gold in Confederate Currency (Graybacks) from McCandless\n\nBiweekly grayback price series from McCandless (1996), Appendix Table\n1, p. 669.\n\n    The data for the South comes from a newspaper column (of unknown\n    origin) found glued into a blank back page of the Virginia State\n    Library's copy of Ernest A. Smith's (1901) The History of the\n    Confederate Treasury.\n\n    As best I can tell, this Southern data set has not been used\n    before. The standardreference is from the Hammond papers, a copy\n    of a card issued by the Wm. B. Isaacs & Co., bankers with monthly\n    prices for the North on one side and for the South on the\n    other. This is the source of the frequently referenced Southern\n    prices in Todd's Confederate Finance. An additional source of\n    Southern prices is from a letter to the New York Evening Post of\n    August 4, 1896 where prices are given for every 10 days. The\n    author of the letter is identified only as E. C. M. The data from\n    the Isaccs and ECM sources are similar to what I use.\n\nWeidenmier (2002) discusses problems with this series, contrasting it \nwith his data.\n\n    Problems with the grayback series is that it reports constant prices\n    for weeks at a time, is of unknown origin for an unknown market, is\n    inconsistent with the New York Evening Post price series (On Jan 1,\n    1865 the Post lists a price of 34 for 1 while McCandless reports 60\n    for 1), and it is unclear whether they are bid or ask prices. \\textcite{Weidenmier2002}\n",

Smith's (1901) The History of the\n    Confederate Treasury.\n\n    As best I can tell, this Southern data set has not been used\n    before. The standardreference is from the Hammond papers, a copy\n    of a card issued by the Wm. B. Isaacs & Co., bankers with monthly\n    prices for the North on one side and for the South on the\n    other. This is the source of the frequently referenced Southern\n    prices in Todd's Confederate Finance. An additional source of\n    Southern prices is from a letter to the New York Evening Post of\n    August 4, 1896 where prices are given for every 10 days. The\n    author of the letter is identified only as E. C. M. The data from\n    the Isaccs and ECM sources are similar to what I use.\n\nWeidenmier (2002) discusses problems with this series, contrasting it \nwith his data.\n\n    Problems with the grayback series is that it reports constant prices\n    for weeks at a time, is of unknown origin for an unknown market, is\n    inconsistent with the New York Evening Post price series (On Jan 1,\n    1865 the Post lists a price of 34 for 1 while McCandless reports 60\n    for 1), and it is unclear whether they are bid or ask prices. \\textcite{Weidenmier2002}\n",

These periods are\n    filled in by gold price quotations from the nearby Wilmington,\n    North Carolina, money market, whose prices were often quoted\n    in the Richmond newspapers.  Newspapers from Petersburg, North\n    Carolina, Virginia,Mobile, Alabama, Wilmington, Virginia,\n    Raleigh, North Carolina, Lynchburg, Augusta, Georgia,\n    Columbus, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, were also\n    examined for price quotes from the Richmond market(see\n    Appendix).Often, these papers would quote trades not reported\n    in the Richmond newspapers.  In addition, secondary markets\n    existed in most of these cities, although these gold exchanges\n    tended to be considerably less liquid than the Richmond\n    market.\n\nFrom Weidenmier (2002), p. 890,\n\n    Grayback/gold price quotations were taken from the following\n    newspapers:Richmond Dispatch, Richmond Examiner, Richmond\n    Whig, Richmond Enquirer, Petersburg Express,\n    Wilmington Journal, Columbus Daily-Sun,\n    Charleston Mercury,Lynchburg Virginian,and the Mobile\n    Tribune.Richmondgrayback/gold price quotations were also\n    cross-checked against prices in the Raleigh, Augusta,and Mobile\n    gold markets using the following newspapers: Raleigh\n    Weekly Register, Mobile Tribune,Mobile Advertiser and Register,\n    and Augusta Daily Constitutionalist.  \n",

The five series\n  are the Confederate dollar prices of a gold dollar; bonds from the $100 million loan;\n  bonds from the $15 million loan; Virginia state bonds; and Richmond city bonds.
