These periods are\n    filled in by gold price quotations from the nearby Wilmington,\n    North Carolina, money market, whose prices were often quoted\n    in the Richmond newspapers.  Newspapers from Petersburg, North\n    Carolina, Virginia,Mobile, Alabama, Wilmington, Virginia,\n    Raleigh, North Carolina, Lynchburg, Augusta, Georgia,\n    Columbus, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, were also\n    examined for price quotes from the Richmond market(see\n    Appendix).Often, these papers would quote trades not reported\n    in the Richmond newspapers.  In addition, secondary markets\n    existed in most of these cities, although these gold exchanges\n    tended to be considerably less liquid than the Richmond\n    market.\n\nFrom Weidenmier (2002), p. 890,\n\n    Grayback/gold price quotations were taken from the following\n    newspapers:Richmond Dispatch, Richmond Examiner, Richmond\n    Whig, Richmond Enquirer, Petersburg Express,\n    Wilmington Journal, Columbus Daily-Sun,\n    Charleston Mercury,Lynchburg Virginian,and the Mobile\n    Tribune.Richmondgrayback/gold price quotations were also\n    cross-checked against prices in the Raleigh, Augusta,and Mobile\n    gold markets using the following newspapers: Raleigh\n    Weekly Register, Mobile Tribune,Mobile Advertiser and Register,\n    and Augusta Daily Constitutionalist.  \n",

      "description": "Confederate interest rates 1861-1865\n\nData on the gold yields of multiple Confederate bonds between January 1862 and\nDecember 1864 from [DavisPecquet1990]_, Table 2, p. 148.\n\nThe note from the original data  (p. 147) reads\n\n  Five price series form the basis for the calculations used in this article. The five series\n  are the Confederate dollar prices of a gold dollar; bonds from the $100 million loan;\n  bonds from the $15 million loan; Virginia state bonds; and Richmond city bonds. The\n  data come from market reports in Richmond newspapers, including the Richmond\n  Whig, the Richmond Sentinel, the Richmond Enquirer, and the Richmond Dispatch. We\n  also have some quotations for railroad bonds from these papers. The data for the\n  summer months of 1864 come from the Wilmington Journal of Wilmington, NC, due to\n  a lack of bond price quotations in the Richmond market. The bond quotations were\n  taken from reports as near as possible to mid-month. Gold price quotations were taken\n  nearest the date of bond quotation from the $100 million loan. When a range was given\n  we took the upper bound for the long-term rate, and when more than one quote was\n  available on a particular maturity date or on gold an average was taken. The gold prices\n  for two dates-August 1863 and October 1864-were obtained by interpolation using\n  data from Richard Todd as a guide.\n\n  In order to calculate yields to maturity it is necessary to have a maturity date. The day\n  and month of maturity were not known for any issue so we used mid-year, July 1. The\n  $15 million loan matured in 1871. There were various maturity dates for the other issues.\n  For the $100 million loan there were many maturity dates. When maturity dates were\n  reported we used the issues that matured in 1881, or the year nearest to that date\n  because it was the most often reported. For about the first year and a half of the period\n  under study the maturity dates on bonds from the $100 million loan were unspecified.\n  We took this to mean that the yield curve was flat and so used 1881 as the maturity date.\n  The maturity date was seldom given for the Virginia state and Richmond city bonds, so\n  we chose the year 1887. In that year some bonds did mature, and it was roughly the\n  average maturity date for the dated long-term issues that we do have. Some experimen-\n  tation with alternative dates revealed that the arguments and conclusions of the text are\n  not sensitive to different maturity dates.\n\n  The actual market date was used in the calculation of the yield to maturity. All of the\n  raw data are available on request from the authors. The data used to construct the\n  diagrams are presented in Table 2.\n",

The data here correct several mistakes in that data.\nWesley Mitchell's (1903) daily series of the price of a gold dollar in greenbacks in New York.\nNote from Mitchell (1903), p. 423\n\n    Explanatory Note. There are two well-authenticated tables that\n    show the average monthly and yearly value of currency in gold\n    during the Civil War: (1) a table published by the American\n    Almanac (see, e.g., issue of 1889, p. 3(1); (2) a table\n    prepared by the Bureau of Statistics (Finance, Commerce and\n    Immigration of the United States, Series of 1895-96, No. 4,\n    p. 518). For the years 1X62-65 these tables are identical; the\n    figures given below are taken from the second. This table was\n    prepared by Mr. E B. Elliott, actuary of tho treasury, in the\n    following manner: four dally quotations of the rates of gold\n    at New York, viz., the opening, highest, lowest, and closing\n    prices, were recorded; from them a daily average was made, and\n    from these average daily prices was prepared the average rate\n    for each month.\n\n    The table of daily highest and lowest prices is based, for the\n    reasons assigned in the text (Part II, chap, iii, sec. i), upon\n    the tables given in the Report of the Chamber of Commerce of the\n    State of New York for 1865-66, Part II, pp. 130-33. The figures\n    for the first eleven days of January, 1862, however, are supplied\n    from the daily reports of the premium on gold in the New York\n    Commercial Advertiser.\n\nDaily series of the price of a gold dollar in greenbacks in New York from Wesley C. Mitchell *Gold, Prices, and Wages under the Greenback Standard*, Appendix, Table 1: \"Daily highest and lowest premium on gold and price of greenbacks in gold\", pp. 288-338.\nMitchell's more extensive discussion of these data on p. 185-187.\n\n    The price of gold in currency, as determined by transactions in these\n    New York markets, was regularly reported by telegraph in all\n    considerable towns of the United States, and everywhere accepted as\n    authoritative. There is no necessity for taking account of the premium\n    on gold in other places, because local markets were dominated by the\n    New York quotations. The money columns of the daily newspapers and the\n    weekly or monthly issues of the financial journals gave full reports\n    of current fluctuations, and more permanent records were made by the\n    compilation of a number of tables showing the highest and lowest\n    prices each day for a series of years. Such tables may be found in\n    *Hunt's Merchants' Magazine*, the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle*,\n    the *Bankers' Magazine*, and the annual *Reports of the Chamber of\n    Commerce of the State of New York*.\n\n    All of these tables appear to be constructed in the same general\n    manner from the recorded transactions of the most important of the\n    New York markets. From January 13, 1862, to June 20, 1864, they\n    are based upon sales at the stock exchange. On June 21 the \"gold\n    bill\" went into effect and stopped all dealing in gold outside the\n    private offices of brokers. From this time until the repeal of the\n    \"gold bill\" by the act of July 2, there was no organized market,\n    and the quotations are those ruling on the street. After the\n    repeal, transactions in gold on the stock exchange were\n    infrequent, and most of the business was done in the \"gold room.\"\n    From July 1864 on, therefore, the tables are based upon the latter\n    market.\n\n    In studying the fluctuations in the gold value of the paper\n    currency it is necessary to go back to these records of the daily\n    premium. As the differences between the tables mentioned are\n    slight, it matters little which set is accepted as a basis for the\n    investigation. I have decided to use the tables published in the\n    chamber of commerce reports, not only because of the official\n    character of the source from which they are taken, but also\n    because they contain fewer obvious errors of the press than some\n    of the others. To adapt them better to the purposes of the present\n    chapter I have altered their form. As published, the tables show\n    the highest and lowest price paid each day in currency for $100 in\n    gold. This form of statement gives the impression that the\n    fluctuations were due to extraordinary changes in the valuation at\n    which gold was held by the community, whereas in fact they were\n    due mainly to changes in the community's valuation of the notes of\n    the government. When the market quotation was 200 the explanation,\n    of course, was not that men esteemed gold twice as highly as they\n    had done in 1861, but rather that they esteemed the paper currency\n    but half as highly as they had when it was redeemable in specie. A\n    much juster impression of the significance of the change in the\n    relative values of gold and paper money is therefore given by\n    quoting currency at a discount in gold than by quoting gold at a\n    premium in paper; by saying, to use a numerical example, that $100\n    in greenbacks was-worth $50 in gold, than by saying that $100 in\n    gold was worth $200 in greenbacks. For this reason the chamber of\n    commerce tables for the years 1862 to 1865 have been converted\n    into tables showing the highest and lowest daily prices of\n    currency in gold. These tables, given in full in the Appendix,\n    furnish a basis for studying the remarkable changes in the gold\n    value of the currency during the Civil War.\n\nThe original data source for Mitchell is the *Report of the Chamber of Commerce*, which can be found at http://books.google.com/books?id=9X8pAAAAYAAJ. \nThis data in this table was taken from `EH.net Greenback Series <http://eh.net/databases/greenback/>`. The associated documentation reads,\n\n    We did not collect the data in the usual sense; we simply copied it from the tables in:\n\n    Mitchell, Wesley C., 1903. A history of the Greenbacks. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.\n\nHowever, Mitchell (1903) only includes greenback prices from 1862-1865 on pp. 425-428. they must have actually copied it from Mitchell (1908) which  has prices from 1903-1908.\nMitchell (1908, p. 2-3) discusses the data,\n\n    The prices of gold in these various exchanges were regularly reported\n    in the financial columns of the daily papers\u2014often in much detail. The\n    financial journals\u2014such as *Hunt's Merchants' Magazine*, the *Bankers'\n    Magazine*, and the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle* \u2014 usually\n    contented themselves with publishing the opening, highest, lowest, and\n    closing prices for each day. At intervals they compiled summary tables\n    of daily highest and lowest prices for months or years. Similar tables\n    were included in the statistical reports of such bodies as the Chamber\n    of Commerce of the State of New York, and in the almanacs issued by\n    various newspapers.\n\n    A more detailed record of the price of gold was preserved for most of\n    the years of the paper standard in an annual publication issued by\n    Mr. J. C. Mersereau, Register of the Gold Exchange, under the title\n    \"American Gold, 1862-(date of issue).\" This little volume usually gave\n    for the preceding year the quotation for gold at ten o'clock and every\n    quarter hour thereafter until three in the afternoon of each business\n    day, and in all cases it gave the highest and lowest prices for every\n    business day from January 13, 1862, when gold was first quoted on the\n    Stock Exchange to the end of the previous year.  \n\n    The tables of daily highest and lowest prices of gold found in the\n    most important of these sources\u2014namely: the *Commercial and Financial\n    Chronicle*, the *Reports of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of\n    New York*, and Mersereau's *American Gold* \u2014are in close agreement\n    with each other. Numerous small discrepancies exist\u2014the quotations\n    frequently vary by an eighth, sometimes by a quarter; but it matters\n    little which set of tables is followed. Since Mersereau was the\n    official register of the Gold Exchange, however, his tables take\n    precedence in authority. Accordingly, Table 1, in the appendix, which\n    gives the daily highest and lowest prices of gold, is based on\n    \"*American Gold*, 1862-1878''\u2014the latest issue of Mersereau's annual I\n    have been able to find. To guard against repeating the typographical\n    errors which occur in Mersereau's table I have collated it with the\n    Chamber of Commerce table and made several corrections. Since\n    Mersereau's table is not available for 1878, the Chamber of Commerce\n    figures, checked by those of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle,\n    are used for the last year of the paper standard. To save space the\n    premium on gold is given, instead of the price of gold in currency;\n    and, to facilitate study of the depreciation in the specie value of\n    the currency, columns have been added giving the prices of greenbacks\n    in gold corresponding to the daily highest and lowest premiums on gold\n    in greenbacks.\n\n    Mersereau does not state explicitly from what markets his quotations\n    are taken; but comparison with other reports indicate that they refer\n    to the Stock Exchange for January 13, 1862, to June 20, 1864, and\n    thereafter to the Gold Exchange, except for the first part of October,\n    1869, when the Gold Exchange was closed and dealings were conducted on\n    the Stock Exchange. The data for January 1-11, 1862, I have supplied\n    from the financial columns of New York daily papers.\n\nThe original data in Mitchell includes columns for \"Premium on gold\" and \"Price of Greenbacks in Gold\". The Willard, et. al. version only includes the greenback prices column.\nI was not able to find a full-text version of the original source of Mitchell's data, \"American Gold\" by J.C. Mersereau on Google books (October 2011).\n[Mitchell1903]_ (p. 425-428) includes a similar table of greenback prices in gold for the years 1862-1865, which uses *Report of the Chamber of Commerce of the of New York* for 1865-66, Part II, pp. 130-33 as its source.\n",

      "description": "Price of Gold in Confederate Currency (Graybacks) from McCandless\n\nBiweekly grayback price series from McCandless (1996), Appendix Table\n1, p. 669.\n\n    The data for the South comes from a newspaper column (of unknown\n    origin) found glued into a blank back page of the Virginia State\n    Library's copy of Ernest A. Smith's (1901) The History of the\n    Confederate Treasury.\n\n    As best I can tell, this Southern data set has not been used\n    before. The standardreference is from the Hammond papers, a copy\n    of a card issued by the Wm. B. Isaacs & Co., bankers with monthly\n    prices for the North on one side and for the South on the\n    other. This is the source of the frequently referenced Southern\n    prices in Todd's Confederate Finance. An additional source of\n    Southern prices is from a letter to the New York Evening Post of\n    August 4, 1896 where prices are given for every 10 days. The\n    author of the letter is identified only as E. C. M. The data from\n    the Isaccs and ECM sources are similar to what I use.\n\nWeidenmier (2002) discusses problems with this series, contrasting it \nwith his data.\n\n    Problems with the grayback series is that it reports constant prices\n    for weeks at a time, is of unknown origin for an unknown market, is\n    inconsistent with the New York Evening Post price series (On Jan 1,\n    1865 the Post lists a price of 34 for 1 while McCandless reports 60\n    for 1), and it is unclear whether they are bid or ask prices. \\textcite{Weidenmier2002}\n",
