# Civil War (U.S.) Era Financial and Economic Data

Miscellaneous financial and economic datasets from the period around the U.S. Civil War gathered from a variety of sources.

This dataset follows the [Data Package](http://www.dataprotocols.org/en/latest/data-packages.html) standard.

This dataset follows something like
[Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- MAJOR version: changes to existing data
- MINOR version: new data that does not alter existing data
- PATCH version: changes which don't affect the data.
