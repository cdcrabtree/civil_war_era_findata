# Civil War (U.S.) Era Financial and Economic Data

Miscellaneous financial and economic datasets from the period around the U.S. Civil War gathered from a variety of sources.

This is by no means a complete collection of available data, but consists of some datasets that I found or collected for my own research.


- `data/greenbacks.csv`: Daily exchange rates of greenbacks to gold dollars in New York, 1862-1879. Mitchell (1908) data
- `data/holidays.csv`: New York market holidays: 1860-1879
