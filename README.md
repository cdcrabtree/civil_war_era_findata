# Civil War (U.S.) Era Financial and Economic Data

Miscellaneous financial and economic datasets from the period around the U.S. Civil War gathered from a variety of sources.

This is by no means a complete collection of available data, but consists of some datasets that I found or collected for my own research.

This dataset follows the [Data Package](http://www.dataprotocols.org/en/latest/data-packages.html) standard.
