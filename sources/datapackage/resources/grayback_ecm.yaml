  Price of Gold in Confederate Currency (Graybacks) from McCandless

  Biweekly grayback price series from McCandless (1996), Appendix Table
  1, p. 669.

      The data for the South comes from a newspaper column (of unknown
      origin) found glued into a blank back page of the Virginia State
      Library's copy of Ernest A. Smith's (1901) The History of the
      Confederate Treasury.

      As best I can tell, this Southern data set has not been used
      before. The standardreference is from the Hammond papers, a copy
      of a card issued by the Wm. B. Isaacs & Co., bankers with monthly
      prices for the North on one side and for the South on the
      other. This is the source of the frequently referenced Southern
      prices in Todd's Confederate Finance. An additional source of
      Southern prices is from a letter to the New York Evening Post of
      August 4, 1896 where prices are given for every 10 days. The
      author of the letter is identified only as E. C. M. The data from
      the Isaccs and ECM sources are similar to what I use.

  Weidenmier (2002) discusses problems with this series, contrasting it 
  with his data.

      Problems with the grayback series is that it reports constant prices
      for weeks at a time, is of unknown origin for an unknown market, is
      inconsistent with the New York Evening Post price series (On Jan 1,
      1865 the Post lists a price of 34 for 1 while McCandless reports 60
      for 1), and it is unclear whether they are bid or ask prices. \textcite{Weidenmier2002}
