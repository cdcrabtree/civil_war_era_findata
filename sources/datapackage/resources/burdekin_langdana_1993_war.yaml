  Confederate War News from Burdekin and Langdana (1993)
  
  This is set to +1 for 1863Q3 after Chancellorsville and during Lee's
  Maryland campaign, -1 for 1862Q2 (Peninsula Campaign), 1863:4 (Gettysburg and Vicksburg) and 1864:1 (costly battle of Chickamagua).  Their guideline for constructing the dummy was Schwab (1901, ch 9) major 'crises of confidence' in Richmond. The dummy variable is set to 0 in 1864:2 and 1864:3 due to the stalled Overland and Petersburg campaigns and the nomination of McClellan. 

  These data extend the original data by setting it to -1 for 1864Q4 and 1865Q1 although the Burdekin and Langdana analysis stops in 1864Q3 due to a lack of data in other variables.
