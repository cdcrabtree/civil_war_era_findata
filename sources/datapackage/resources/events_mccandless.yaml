  Major military and non-military events of the Civil War from McCandless (1996)

  Appendix Tables 2 "Major military events of Civil War" and 3 "Major non-military events of the Civil War" in McCandless (1996), p. 670:

    Included in the list are all events noted as \"Important\", major or
    decisive Catton (1971), Pratt (1948), Guinnane et al. (1993).

  The original tables use vague terms such as \"late\" or \"early\".
  I added exact *start_date* and *end_date* values as follows,

  - Fall of New Orleans
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_New_Orleans lists the dates
    of April 25 to May 1.
  - Seven Days Battles: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_Battle
    Battle of Oak Grove on June 25 to Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1
  - Since no exact date was given for the \"Re-election of Lincoln
    certain\", and it does not correspond to a discrete event, I just
    estimated it as the second half of October.

  The sources of these events are 

  - Pratt, Fletcher. Ordeal by Fire. New York: William Sloane, 1948.
  - Catton, Bruce. The Civil War. New York: Fairfax, 1971.
  - Guinnane, Timothy W. and Rosen, Harvey S. and Willard, Kristen L, "Turning Points in the Civil War: Views from the Greenback Market. American Economic Review. 1996.
