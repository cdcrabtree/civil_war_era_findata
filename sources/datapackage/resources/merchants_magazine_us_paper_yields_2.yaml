  Yield data for U.S. government and state bonds 1855-1865 (price series level)

  Prices quoted in the *Merchant's Magazine* can correspond to multiple bond issues.
  ``merchants_magazine_state_govt_loans_yields`` shows yields, maturity, etc. for all
  bonds associated with a price series.
  This table aggregates back to the price series level, by taking the weighted mean (using ``wgt``)
  for each numerical column.

        For ``five_twenty`` and ``ten_forty`` these are 1 / n for all possible redemption years between 
        the possible du

        For other series with multiple bonds, the weight is equal to the proportion of that bond in terms
        of dollars to all other bonds matching that series.
        This method is especially suspect for ``seven_thirties``.
