  Bond Metadata

  Contains issue dates, coupon periods, maturity, cashflow, etc. data about bond issues for which there is price data.

  - Many quoted price series may correspond to multiple bond similar issues. 
  - Callable bonds (10-40s and 5-20s) have multiple entries, one for a potential call in each year.
  - Metadata on state bonds is rather scarce. 
    Sometimes a range of years is known; in which case, there is a bond issue for each year.
    If no range is known, then a bond issue for each potential year is used (based on the empirical distribution of all bonds for which maturity years are known).

  The data are an ``object``, with an 
  Each bond issue is an ``object`` containting the following entries.

  - ``cashflows``: ``object``
    - ``date``: ``array``. Date of cashflow. %Y-%m-%d.
    - ``cashflows``: ``array``. amount of cashflow in gold dollars
  - ``interest``: ``number``. Annual interest rate
  - ``periods``: ``array``. Each entry is an ``object`` with keys ``month`` and ``day`` for the month and day of a periodic payment.
  - ``issue_date``: Date of issue. %Y-%m-%d.
  - ``maturity_date``: Date of maturity. %Y-%m-%d.
  - ``call``: For callable bonds, ``TRUE`` if a date before maturity, ``FALSE`` if maturity.
