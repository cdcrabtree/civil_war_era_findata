  Major Confederate Financial Events from Pequet, Davis and Kango (2004)

  These are major financial events used in the quantitative analysis of the price of North Carolina Bank Notes
  in Pequet, Davis, and Kango, *Southern Economic Journal*, 2004.  See the descriptions on p. 627--628.

  In their analyses, the second funding act was not used because it went into effect shortly after the Confederate military defeats in
  July 1863 (Gettysburg, Vicksburg).
