  Daily price of greenbacks in gold in New York (1862-1879)
  
  The price of greenbacks comes from Mitchel (1908),
  which was put in machine format by Willard et. al. and made available on http://eh.net/databases/greenback/.
  The data here correct several mistakes in that data.

  Wesley Mitchell's (1903) daily series of the price of a gold dollar in
  greenbacks in New York.

  Note from Mitchell (1903), p. 423

      Explanatory Note. There are two well-authenticated tables that
      show the average monthly and yearly value of currency in gold
      during the Civil War: (1) a table published by the American
      Almanac (see, e.g., issue of 1889, p. 3(1); (2) a table
      prepared by the Bureau of Statistics (Finance, Commerce and
      Immigration of the United States, Series of 1895-96, No. 4,
      p. 518). For the years 1X62-65 these tables are identical; the
      figures given below are taken from the second. This table was
      prepared by Mr. E B. Elliott, actuary of tho treasury, in the
      following manner: four dally quotations of the rates of gold
      at New York, viz., the opening, highest, lowest, and closing
      prices, were recorded; from them a daily average was made, and
      from these average daily prices was prepared the average rate
      for each month.

      The table of daily highest and lowest prices is based, for the
      reasons assigned in the text (Part II, chap, iii, sec. i), upon
      the tables given in the Report of the Chamber of Commerce of the
      State of New York for 1865-66, Part II, pp. 130-33. The figures
      for the first eleven days of January, 1862, however, are supplied
      from the daily reports of the premium on gold in the New York
      Commercial Advertiser.

  Daily series of the price of a gold dollar in greenbacks in New York
  from Wesley C. Mitchell *Gold, Prices, and Wages under the Greenback
  Standard*, Appendix, Table 1: "Daily highest and lowest premium on
  gold and price of greenbacks in gold", pp. 288-338.

  Mitchell's more extensive discussion of these data on p. 185-187.

      The price of gold in currency, as determined by transactions in these
      New York markets, was regularly reported by telegraph in all
      considerable towns of the United States, and everywhere accepted as
      authoritative. There is no necessity for taking account of the premium
      on gold in other places, because local markets were dominated by the
      New York quotations. The money columns of the daily newspapers and the
      weekly or monthly issues of the financial journals gave full reports
      of current fluctuations, and more permanent records were made by the
      compilation of a number of tables showing the highest and lowest
      prices each day for a series of years. Such tables may be found in
      *Hunt's Merchants' Magazine*, the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle*,
      the *Bankers' Magazine*, and the annual *Reports of the Chamber of
      Commerce of the State of New York*.

      All of these tables appear to be constructed in the same general
      manner from the recorded transactions of the most important of the
      New York markets. From January 13, 1862, to June 20, 1864, they
      are based upon sales at the stock exchange. On June 21 the "gold
      bill" went into effect and stopped all dealing in gold outside the
      private offices of brokers. From this time until the repeal of the
      "gold bill" by the act of July 2, there was no organized market,
      and the quotations are those ruling on the street. After the
      repeal, transactions in gold on the stock exchange were
      infrequent, and most of the business was done in the "gold room."
      From July 1864 on, therefore, the tables are based upon the latter
      market.

      In studying the fluctuations in the gold value of the paper
      currency it is necessary to go back to these records of the daily
      premium. As the differences between the tables mentioned are
      slight, it matters little which set is accepted as a basis for the
      investigation. I have decided to use the tables published in the
      chamber of commerce reports, not only because of the official
      character of the source from which they are taken, but also
      because they contain fewer obvious errors of the press than some
      of the others. To adapt them better to the purposes of the present
      chapter I have altered their form. As published, the tables show
      the highest and lowest price paid each day in currency for $100 in
      gold. This form of statement gives the impression that the
      fluctuations were due to extraordinary changes in the valuation at
      which gold was held by the community, whereas in fact they were
      due mainly to changes in the community's valuation of the notes of
      the government. When the market quotation was 200 the explanation,
      of course, was not that men esteemed gold twice as highly as they
      had done in 1861, but rather that they esteemed the paper currency
      but half as highly as they had when it was redeemable in specie. A
      much juster impression of the significance of the change in the
      relative values of gold and paper money is therefore given by
      quoting currency at a discount in gold than by quoting gold at a
      premium in paper; by saying, to use a numerical example, that $100
      in greenbacks was-worth $50 in gold, than by saying that $100 in
      gold was worth $200 in greenbacks. For this reason the chamber of
      commerce tables for the years 1862 to 1865 have been converted
      into tables showing the highest and lowest daily prices of
      currency in gold. These tables, given in full in the Appendix,
      furnish a basis for studying the remarkable changes in the gold
      value of the currency during the Civil War.

  The original data source for Mitchell is the *Report of the Chamber of
  Commerce*, which can be found at
  http://books.google.com/books?id=9X8pAAAAYAAJ. 

  This data in this table was taken from `EH.net Greenback Series
  <http://eh.net/databases/greenback/>`. The associated documentation reads,

      We did not collect the data in the usual sense; we simply copied it from the tables in:

      Mitchell, Wesley C., 1903. A history of the Greenbacks. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

  However, Mitchell (1903) only includes greenback prices from 1862-1865
  on pp. 425-428. they must have actually copied it from Mitchell (1908) which 
  has prices from 1903-1908.

  Mitchell (1908, p. 2-3) discusses the data,

      The prices of gold in these various exchanges were regularly reported
      in the financial columns of the daily papers—often in much detail. The
      financial journals—such as *Hunt's Merchants' Magazine*, the *Bankers'
      Magazine*, and the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle* — usually
      contented themselves with publishing the opening, highest, lowest, and
      closing prices for each day. At intervals they compiled summary tables
      of daily highest and lowest prices for months or years. Similar tables
      were included in the statistical reports of such bodies as the Chamber
      of Commerce of the State of New York, and in the almanacs issued by
      various newspapers.

      A more detailed record of the price of gold was preserved for most of
      the years of the paper standard in an annual publication issued by
      Mr. J. C. Mersereau, Register of the Gold Exchange, under the title
      "American Gold, 1862-(date of issue)." This little volume usually gave
      for the preceding year the quotation for gold at ten o'clock and every
      quarter hour thereafter until three in the afternoon of each business
      day, and in all cases it gave the highest and lowest prices for every
      business day from January 13, 1862, when gold was first quoted on the
      Stock Exchange to the end of the previous year.  

      The tables of daily highest and lowest prices of gold found in the
      most important of these sources—namely: the *Commercial and Financial
      Chronicle*, the *Reports of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of
      New York*, and Mersereau's *American Gold* —are in close agreement
      with each other. Numerous small discrepancies exist—the quotations
      frequently vary by an eighth, sometimes by a quarter; but it matters
      little which set of tables is followed. Since Mersereau was the
      official register of the Gold Exchange, however, his tables take
      precedence in authority. Accordingly, Table 1, in the appendix, which
      gives the daily highest and lowest prices of gold, is based on
      "*American Gold*, 1862-1878''—the latest issue of Mersereau's annual I
      have been able to find. To guard against repeating the typographical
      errors which occur in Mersereau's table I have collated it with the
      Chamber of Commerce table and made several corrections. Since
      Mersereau's table is not available for 1878, the Chamber of Commerce
      figures, checked by those of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle,
      are used for the last year of the paper standard. To save space the
      premium on gold is given, instead of the price of gold in currency;
      and, to facilitate study of the depreciation in the specie value of
      the currency, columns have been added giving the prices of greenbacks
      in gold corresponding to the daily highest and lowest premiums on gold
      in greenbacks.

      Mersereau does not state explicitly from what markets his quotations
      are taken; but comparison with other reports indicate that they refer
      to the Stock Exchange for January 13, 1862, to June 20, 1864, and
      thereafter to the Gold Exchange, except for the first part of October,
      1869, when the Gold Exchange was closed and dealings were conducted on
      the Stock Exchange. The data for January 1-11, 1862, I have supplied
      from the financial columns of New York daily papers.

  The original data in Mitchell includes columns for "Premium on gold"
  and "Price of Greenbacks in Gold". The Willard, et. al. version only
  includes the greenback prices column.

  I was not able to find a full-text version of the original source of
  Mitchell's data, "American Gold" by J.C. Mersereau on Google books
  (October 2011).

  [Mitchell1903]_ (p. 425-428) includes a similar table of greenback
  prices in gold for the years 1862-1865, which uses *Report of the
  Chamber of Commerce of the of New York* for 1865-66, Part II,
  pp. 130-33 as its source.
