    Price of gold in Confederate Dollars (Graybacks) from Weidenmier (2002)

    This price series is from the same sources as `grayback_weidenmier_2`,
    but only includes Richmond prices, is higher frequency (weekly rather
    than biweekly), and includes a longer range of dates. 

    From Weidenmier (2002), p. 878

       An extensive search of more than a dozen newspapers yielded a
       series of 486 grayback prices from public auctions and private
       brokerage trades in Richmond between May 27, 1861, and February 15,
       1865.

    From Weidenmier (2002), footnote 2, p. 878

        All quotes are taken from Richmond except during some
        stretches in the summer and fall of 1864 when Richmond
        newspapers stopped reporting money prices. These periods are
        filled in by gold price quotations from the nearby Wilmington,
        North Carolina, money market, whose prices were often quoted
        in the Richmond newspapers.  Newspapers from Petersburg, North
        Carolina, Virginia,Mobile, Alabama, Wilmington, Virginia,
        Raleigh, North Carolina, Lynchburg, Augusta, Georgia,
        Columbus, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, were also
        examined for price quotes from the Richmond market(see
        Appendix).Often, these papers would quote trades not reported
        in the Richmond newspapers.  In addition, secondary markets
        existed in most of these cities, although these gold exchanges
        tended to be considerably less liquid than the Richmond
        market.

    From Weidenmier (2002), p. 890,

        Grayback/gold price quotations were taken from the following
        newspapers:Richmond Dispatch, Richmond Examiner, Richmond
        Whig, Richmond Enquirer, Petersburg Express,

        Charleston Mercury,Lynchburg Virginian,and the Mobile

        gold markets using the following newspapers: Raleigh
        Weekly Register, Mobile Tribune,Mobile Advertiser and Register,
        and Augusta Daily Constitutionalist.
