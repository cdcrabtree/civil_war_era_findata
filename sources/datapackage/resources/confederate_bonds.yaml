  Confederate interest rates 1861-1865

  Interest rates from Table 2 in Davis and Pecquet (1990).

  The note from the original data  (p. 147) reads

    Five price series form the basis for the calculations used in this article. The five series
    are the Confederate dollar prices of a gold dollar; bonds from the $100 million loan;
    bonds from the $15 million loan; Virginia state bonds; and Richmond city bonds. The
    data come from market reports in Richmond newspapers, including the Richmond
    Whig, the Richmond Sentinel, the Richmond Enquirer, and the Richmond Dispatch. We
    also have some quotations for railroad bonds from these papers. The data for the
    summer months of 1864 come from the Wilmington Journal of Wilmington, NC, due to
    a lack of bond price quotations in the Richmond market. The bond quotations were
    taken from reports as near as possible to mid-month. Gold price quotations were taken
    nearest the date of bond quotation from the $100 million loan. When a range was given
    we took the upper bound for the long-term rate, and when more than one quote was
    available on a particular maturity date or on gold an average was taken. The gold prices
    for two dates-August 1863 and October 1864-were obtained by interpolation using
    data from Richard Todd as a guide.

    In order to calculate yields to maturity it is necessary to have a maturity date. The day
    and month of maturity were not known for any issue so we used mid-year, July 1. The
    $15 million loan matured in 1871. There were various maturity dates for the other issues.
    For the $100 million loan there were many maturity dates. When maturity dates were
    reported we used the issues that matured in 1881, or the year nearest to that date
    because it was the most often reported. For about the first year and a half of the period
    under study the maturity dates on bonds from the $100 million loan were unspecified.
    We took this to mean that the yield curve was flat and so used 1881 as the maturity date.
    The maturity date was seldom given for the Virginia state and Richmond city bonds, so
    we chose the year 1887. In that year some bonds did mature, and it was roughly the
    average maturity date for the dated long-term issues that we do have. Some experimen-
    tation with alternative dates revealed that the arguments and conclusions of the text are
    not sensitive to different maturity dates.

    The actual market date was used in the calculation of the yield to maturity. All of the
    raw data are available on request from the authors. The data used to construct the
    diagrams are presented in Table 2.
