Sixes of 1868
===============

There are several anomalies in the price series.

- The price is lower and yield is higher after the Panic of 1857. This doesn't happen for other bonds.
- Even after subtracting accrued interest, there is still drift in the prices between coupon payments. This is likely due to the stickiness and discreteness of prices.  The clean price series looks much better than the dirty price series.
- There is a sharp rise in yields and drop in prices in January 1859. There does not appear to be a good explanation for this.

  - `Feb 1859 <http://books.google.com/books?id=HVomAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA670>`__ "The government sizes are quoted at 3 @ 3 1/2 percent lower than in December last, the semi-annual interest having been paid." (p. 670) The clean prices in the data account for this and there is still a fall in prices.
  - `Mar 1859 <http://books.google.com/books?id=HVomAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA750>`__ "State loans are not as well sustained this month as in January. The absorption of ten millions in gold for account of the sub-treasury, accompanied with a prospect of further demands, has tended to lessen the inquiry for State loans. " No specific discussion of the 6's.


Southern State Bonds
======================

The southern states suspended interest on bond payments starting with the July 1861 coupon payments.
From `June 1861 Bankers' Bond <http://books.google.com/books?id=KVwmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA947>`__,

   State loans have fallen to ruinous prices during the month of
   May.... These low values have partly been caused by the fear that
   these States will not be disposed to provide for the payment of
   their semi annual interest in July next. Their ability to pay is not
   questioned but unfortunately the legislation in the States has
   been revolutionary and suicidal. The tendency to establish stay laws
   has given the final blow to public credit. In Missouri, Pennsylvania
   and other States such unconstitutional laws have been recently
   adopted.

   We see by late Raleigh papers that a Mr. Wooten, a member of the North
   Carolina legislature, had moved a resolution "to suspend all payment
   of interest on all bonds due by this State to individuals or
   corporations in non-slaveholding Stales until present hostilities
   between the North and South shall cease." The resolution was referred
   to the Judiciary Committee. Interest on a part of the State debt fell
   due on the first of April but all coupons when presented at the Bank
   of the Republic in this city, have been returned to the owners with
   tho remark, "No funds."

From `August 1861 Bankers' Magazine <http://books.google.com/books?id=B10mAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA159>`__

   In State loans the market has been active with a decided improvement. ...
   These prices arise after a knowledge on the part of capitalists and operators that the States of Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina have for the present at least suspended payment of interest.

The southern states did pay interest in January 1861; at least Virginia did: http://books.google.com/books?id=KVwmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA810 .

Missouri Bonds
==================

The bonds issued by Missouri
Interestingly, the *Bankers' Magazine* repeatedly questions their price as being higher than warrented by the economic fundamentals.

`Vol 10, p. 574, January 1856 <http://books.google.com/books?id=I1gmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA574>`__

   Missouri Six per Cent Bonds at their present market value will not only realize about seven per cent on their investment but will soon obtain an advance of 5 to 10 per cent. There is no reason why these loans should be any lower than Kentucky or Ohio. The whole Indebtedness of Missouri is but trifling compared with the abundant wealth of the State, and this debt will not be Increased to any alarming extent. The Legislature has at its last session made liberal donations to their railroads and these in turn will contribute largely to the development of tho vast resources of the State.

`Vol 10, p. 751, March 1856 <http://books.google.com/books?id=I1gmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA751>`__
  
  We find that by a recent enactment of the Legislature of Missouri
  that a sinking fund his been created whereby the whole debt of the
  State will in a few years be canceled. Taxation in that State is
  very low, and the expenditures annually very small. The new law
  provides a permanent sinking-fund for the protection of the credit
  of the State. It is accompanied with the act establishing a county
  sinking-fund which, though not immediately advantageous, will be
  found to be so two years hence, when the mill tax comes into
  operation. The law establishing a sinking fund for the city of
  St. Louis is already in force. We understand that this fund already
  amounts to more than five hundred thousand dollars arising from the
  sale of the city buildings the centre market place and city commons
  and that a portion of It Is already available. Installments upon all
  these sales are payable annually until the debt is extinguished
  which with tho annual accruing interest will furnish a very handsome
  fund for the protection of the credit of the city in any emergency.
  Capitalists will hardly fall to pee In these measures the ability
  and the deposition or the State of Missouri and the city and county
  of St Louis to meet all their liabilities Indeed we consider the
  finances of Missouri as established upon as firm n basis as those of
  any Western State Missouri six per cents were recently quoted at 85
  a 85 1/2 with a very limited debt and ample resources while Indiana
  whose debt has been once compromised Is quoted at 81 for a five per
  cent stock This unfair discrimination will we have no doubt be
  speedily rectified and the bonds of the former soon be restored to
  par.

`Vol 11, p. 238, September 1856 <http://books.google.com/books?id=MlkmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA238>`__

   Sales of Missouri Sixes have been made as low as 84 1/2 per cent in
   consequence of the political troubles on the Western borders of
   that State and in Kansas. Those persons familiar with the financial
   position and growing resources of Missouri will avail themselves of
   the occasion to invest at the low quotations now current.

`Vol 12, p. 158, August 1857 http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA158>`__

   Missouri, Louisiana and Tennessee six per cents are extremely low
   at this period, although there are no fresh circumstances that are
   calculated to create distrust in the future payment of regular
   interest. The debt of these States Is amply provided for principal
   and interest

`Vol 12, p. 590, January 1858 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA158>`__

   Measures have been adopted by the legislatures of Virginia and
   Missouri to provide ample funds for the punctual payment of
   interest.

`Vol 13, p. 318, October 1858 <http://books.google.com/books?id=HVomAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA318>`__

   For investment some prefer Indiana bonds to those of Missouri the
   six per cents of the latter being below the five per centa ot the
   former. This will appenr extraordinary when we view the repudiating
   character of Indiana loans and tho greater caution of Missouri in
   creating a State debt.

Finanical Statement of Missouri, `Nov 1859 <http://books.google.com/books?id=H1smAQAAIAAJ&lr&pg=PA157>`__

   We feel impelled to lay this sketch of the finances of Missouri
   before our investing readers the more because it would appear that
   the growing wealth and vital strength of this State together with
   the care exhibited to maintain their credit unimpeachable by their
   full legislative provisions for all contingencies are not fully
   appreciated

`July 1860 <http://books.google.com/books?id=KVwmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA32>`__

 The financial management of this State has never been marked by
 ability One fault was the issue of State bonds to contractors instead
 of selling them in bulk to leading capitalists The increased debt
 authorized by the legislature creates diminished confidence in her
 ability to pay these large sums The past history of rail roads in the
 United States leads us to fear that Missouri like Virginia will have
 to bear the burden and sell out the roads The six per cents of
 Missouri ranged in


`Sep 1860 <http://books.google.com/books?id=KVwmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA236>`__

  In State loans the transactions of the month of July have been large
  in Missouri sixes at a range of 80 7/8 @ 82 1/2. The increased
  public debt of Missouri in 1858--1859 has lessened the market values
  although the credit of the State has not been in the least impaired
  among those who have examined the subject.

`Nov 1860 <http://books.google.com/books?id=KVwmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA414>`__
  
   Speculation usually operate stocks the attention of speculators has
   been attracted to the rail road shares The decline in Missouri's Is
   accounted for by the fact that no provision has as yet been made
   for the January interest and it has become apparent that there will
   be a large deficiency to be supplied by the State the rail roads
   not being in a condition to pay it

   
Panic of 1857
=================

The articles in the *Bankers' Magazine* do not mention domestic political troubles as a cause of the Panic of 1857,

- `August 1857 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA254>`__ Increased export of specie due to foreign exchange, attributed to a demand for specie in England due to insurrection in India.
- `October 1857 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA334>`__ Attributed explicitly to unfavorable foreign trade and unsound banking.
- `November 1857 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA429>`__ More focus on banking failures.
- `December 1857 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA509>`__ Improvement in financial conditions due to influx of specie.
- `January 1858 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA589>`__ Resumption of specie, business confidence.

A brief mention of political troubles in mentioned is in `April 1858 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA847>`__

  On this side the unsettled political questions in Congress have also
  made the market here a little uneasy. The foreign and domestic
  advices together hare operated upon the stock market in Wall Street
  and checked for the present at least the upward movement in the
  value of leading shares From the 1st to the 15th of March there was
  a steady

In Volume 11 of the *Bankers' Magazine* there is no mention of the Dred Scott decision.

Did investors understand yield to maturity?
===============================================

All bonds were quoted as the price for a par value of 100, in currency (even after Jan 1, 1862).
However, they had some idea of yield to maturity.

E.g. `Vol 12, July 1857, p. 70 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA79>`__,

   United States Loans of 1867-8 at present value will purchase
   $145,000 of Missouri Sixes or Pennsylvania Five per cents, the
   former yielding nearly nine per cent and the latter 7 1/2 on the
   investment


California Debt
==================

California debt was the riskiest state debt during that period. It appears that they defaulted a few times, and at other times failed to promptly pay interest.

- Default in 1857 after the California supreme court ruled some of its debt unconstitutional, http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA158.

Misc
==================

- Gold Yields described here:
- Most bonds quoted are "flat" or "diry' This was the convetion of during that period, and can be observed in the data. Macaulay, A21. http://www.nber.org/chapters/c6350.pdf
