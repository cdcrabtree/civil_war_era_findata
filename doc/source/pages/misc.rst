Sixes of 1868
===============

There are several anomalies in the price series.

- The price is lower and yield is higher after the Panic of 1857. This doesn't happen for other bonds.
- Even after subtracting accrued interest, there is still drift in the prices between coupon payments. This is likely due to the stickiness and discreteness of prices.  The clean price series looks much better than the dirty price series.
- There is a sharp rise in yields and drop in prices in January 1859. There does not appear to be a good explanation for this.

  - `Feb 1859 <http://books.google.com/books?id=HVomAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA670>`__ "The government sizes are quoted at 3 @ 3 1/2 percent lower than in December last, the semi-annual interest having been paid." (p. 670) The clean prices in the data account for this and there is still a fall in prices.
  - `Mar 1859 <http://books.google.com/books?id=HVomAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA750>`__ "State loans are not as well sustained this month as in January. The absorption of ten millions in gold for account of the sub-treasury, accompanied with a prospect of further demands, has tended to lessen the inquiry for State loans. " No specific discussion of the 6's.


Southern State Bonds
======================

The southern states suspended interest on bond payments starting with the July 1861 coupon payments.
From `June 1861 Bankers' Bond <http://books.google.com/books?id=KVwmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA947>`__,

   State loans have fallen to ruinous prices during the month of
   May.... These low values have partly been caused by the fear that
   these States will not be disposed to provide for the payment of
   their semi annual interest in July next. Their ability to pay is not
   questioned but unfortunately the legislation in the States has
   been revolutionary and suicidal. The tendency to establish stay laws
   has given the final blow to public credit. In Missouri, Pennsylvania
   and other States such unconstitutional laws have been recently
   adopted.

   We see by late Raleigh papers that a Mr. Wooten, a member of the North
   Carolina legislature, had moved a resolution "to suspend all payment
   of interest on all bonds due by this State to individuals or
   corporations in non-slaveholding Stales until present hostilities
   between the North and South shall cease." The resolution was referred
   to the Judiciary Committee. Interest on a part of the State debt fell
   due on the first of April but all coupons when presented at the Bank
   of the Republic in this city, have been returned to the owners with
   tho remark, "No funds."

From `August 1861 Bankers' Magazine <http://books.google.com/books?id=B10mAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA159>`__

   In State loans the market has been active with a decided improvement. ...
   These prices arise after a knowledge on the part of capitalists and operators that the States of Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina have for the present at least suspended payment of interest.


It is unclear when interest rates were resumed; and whether the debt was restructured or defaulted on.
   
The southern states did pay interest in January 1861; at least Virginia did: http://books.google.com/books?id=KVwmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA810 .
