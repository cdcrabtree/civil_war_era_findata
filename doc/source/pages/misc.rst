Sixes of 1868
===============

There are several anomalies in the price series.

- The price is lower and yield is higher after the Panic of 1857. This doesn't happen for other bonds.
- Even after subtracting accrued interest, there is still drift in the prices between coupon payments. This is likely due to the stickiness and discreteness of prices.  The clean price series looks much better than the dirty price series.
- There is a sharp rise in yields and drop in prices in January 1859. There does not appear to be a good explanation for this.

  - `Feb 1859 <http://books.google.com/books?id=HVomAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA670>`__ "The government sizes are quoted at 3 @ 3 1/2 percent lower than in December last, the semi-annual interest having been paid." (p. 670) The clean prices in the data account for this and there is still a fall in prices.
  - `Mar 1859 <http://books.google.com/books?id=HVomAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA750>`__ "State loans are not as well sustained this month as in January. The absorption of ten millions in gold for account of the sub-treasury, accompanied with a prospect of further demands, has tended to lessen the inquiry for State loans. " No specific discussion of the 6's.
