Bankers Magazine


Printed a table of exchange rates bills between March 1860 until

All prices were in terms of high and low closing rates for sixty-day bills `Example <http://books.google.com/books?id=KVwmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA78>`__.
Prices were quoted at a monthly frequency for the following series:

- London banker's bills
- London Domestic mercantile bills
- London Domestic with bills of lading
- Paris, banker's bills
- Amsterdam, per guilder
- Bremen, per rix dollar
- Hamburgh, per marc banco
- Frankfort

Additionally, the exchange on London is listed at the top of each "Notes on the Money Market".  

See `Vol 15, 975 <http://books.google.com/books?id=g2QmAQAAIAAJ&dq=editions%3AOCLC214718095&lr&pg=PA975>`__ for a discussion of the convention of how they are quoted.

- Paris is quoted in terms of francs per dollar
- London is quoted as the premium on sterling computed at a par value 4.44 dollars per sterling (although the official par rate was closer to 4.84 dollar per sterling).
  This convention dated back to the colonial era when the Spanish dollar was used and persisted until the late 19th century.
- Hamburg is dollars per marc banco, which is a money of account and does not correspond to a coin.
