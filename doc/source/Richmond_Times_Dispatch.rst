  - Aug 19, 1863

      While we should be gratified to learn that the Confederate
      Government secured the conversion of a very large amount of the
      8 per cent. convertible notes into bonds, we are certainly not
      surprised that a large amount of those notes are still in
      circulation. But, nevertheless, as Gov. Letcher says, it was not
      proper to attempt to drive that currency out of circulation by
      discrediting it. Such an expedient not only subjected the public
      to inconvenience, but as an inevitable consequence, it impaired
      the value of the Confederate currency generally, in the public
      estimation — not only that which had been issued prior to April,
      '63, but that which appeared after that date.--This opinion was
      expressed in this paper at the time the measure was adopted, and
      its correctness is pretty well established.

  - June 3, 1864

    Senate bill to authorize the owners of the registered eight per
    cent ten year convertible bonds, issued under the act of 16th May,
    1861 to exchange the same for coupon bonds, was considered and
    passed.


State Loans

Virginia did not issue much debt during the war; instead it relied on the issue
of treasury notes.  It was heavily indebted in 1861 (33 million) due
to "improvement" loans issued during the 1850s.  It suspended interest
to Northerners on June 1862, and stopped paying all interest after
Jan 1862.  (Schwab, 309)

North Carolina issued a large amount of debt during the war. 5 million
approrpriated for war purposes before secession.  Large sums issued
during the war, partly by issuing notes, but largely with State bonds.
Fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1861 1/2 of State receipts were from
laons; in FY 1862, 3/4 of the receipts were from loans.  State debt:
10 mn (1860), 21 mn (1862), 26 mn (1863), 30 mn (1864). (Schwab 307)
North Carolina also stopped paying interest on State bonds (Schwab
309)

Tennessee issued debt early in the war.  Tennessee issued 5 mn at 8
per cent at the time of secession. (Schwab 308) Tennessee paid
interest to Southern bond holders in 1861 (Schwab 309).

Coupon bonds sold at a higher price than registered bonds due to a
liquidity premium. Richmond Examiner, "City Intelligence", Sept 24,
1864, p. 1

    The coupon bonds are more desirable than the registered bonds, because the 
    former are transferable at will, and may be sent abroad for sale at a low
    figure, the difference on exchange yielding a handsome return.

Miscellaneous

From Feb 16, 1865 http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2006.05.1300:article=pos=15

    Rumored putting to sea of Confederate iron-clads from European Ports — the opinion in New York.

    Ben. Wood's paper (the New York News) has a letter from London, saying that the two iron-clad vessels built a year or two ago in France for the Confederates, but stopped through the vigilance of Mr. Dayton, have got to sea since his death, and are cruising under the rebel flag, under the names of Stonewall and Rapidan. He also declares that there is a secret treaty between the Emperor of France and the Richmond authorities. He intimates that the destination of the rebel iron-clads, which he pronounces invulnerable, is New York city, though they may first go to Boston and destroy that city; or they may go to Washington, or Mobile, or Beaufort, or up James river, and attack Grant's base.
    A New York letter, commenting on this intelligence, says:

    ‘ The sensation story published in the Daily News of this morning, in the shape of a London letter, about the departure of two iron-clads from Bordeaux, in the interests of Jeff. Davis, creates some remark, though the statements of that journal, ever acting in the rebel interest, are not entitled to much consideration. Some of our shipmaster are of opinion that the London writer has confounded the two steamers, Union and Ajax, which recently ran out of the Clyde, with the Sphinx and Clops, at Bordeaux. How that is the next steamer from Europe will doubtless apprise us. The supplementary assertion, in the same letter, that the Emperor Napoleon has made a secret treaty with the rebels, stipulating to recognize them about the first of March, may reasonably be set down as moonshine.

    ’ There is a strong suspicion that this canard was concocted to influence Wall street. If so, it has failed of its object, so far as, gold, the real barometer of public feeling, is concerned. The price has fallen several per cent., and is now at a lower figure than it has been in a fortnight.

    Apropos of our relations with France, I may say that Le Courrier des Etats Unis of this morning announces, as if by authority, that M. de Saulx is to be sent to Washington as Minister Plenipotentiary in place of M de Chateau Renard, who had previously been selected for the position. The latter gentlemen, it is hinted, had certain objections to going to Washington, which the Emperor could not overcome. What could they be?

    A New York letter says:

    ‘ Though there are some persons who pooh-pooh the Washington telegram to the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph as to the offer of the three Southern Governors to make peace with General Sherman, there are others who are convinced, if not of its entire truth, that there must be something in it. Gold has fallen in consequence; and the fall would be greater were it not for the scary Louisville dispatches announcing the advance of Hood towards Kentucky.
